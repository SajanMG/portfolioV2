# Modern CSS Techniques

CSS has evolved significantly over the years, providing developers with powerful tools for creating beautiful and responsive layouts. Let's dive into some modern CSS techniques that will enhance your web development skills.

## CSS Grid Layout

CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that makes it easy to create complex layouts.

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  gap: 1rem;
}
```

## Flexbox for Component Layout

Flexbox is perfect for one-dimensional layouts and component alignment.

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}
```

## CSS Custom Properties (Variables)

CSS custom properties allow you to create reusable values throughout your stylesheet.

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #3498db;
  --secondary-color: #2ecc71;
  --font-size-base: 16px;
}

.button {
  background-color: var(--primary-color);
  font-size: var(--font-size-base);
}
```

## Container Queries

Container queries allow you to style elements based on their container's size rather than the viewport.

```css
.card {
  container-type: inline-size;
}

@container (min-width: 300px) {
  .card-content {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
  }
}
```

## Modern Selectors

### :is() and :where()

These pseudo-classes help reduce specificity and make selectors more readable.

```css
/* Instead of */
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
  margin-top: 0;
}

/* Use */
:is(h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6) {
  margin-top: 0;
}
```

## Conclusion

These modern CSS techniques can significantly improve your development workflow and the quality of your web applications. Start incorporating them gradually into your projects to see the benefits.
